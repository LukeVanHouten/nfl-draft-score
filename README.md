# nfl-draft-score

WIP project to score each college whose players were drafted in the NFL draft. Schools who had players drafted high and had more players drafted in general are scored higher. Scoring functions transformed in multiple ways to weight pick number vs number of picks by using the Tukey ladder of powers. Functions included currently are $\sum\limits^p_{i = 1} \frac{1}{n}$, $\sum\limits^p_{i = 1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$, and $\sum\limits^p_{i = 1} \frac{1}{\ln(n + 1)}$, where $p$ represents each pick a college had, and $n$ is the pick number. I plan on adding a linear regression between these scores and other metrics of CFB team skill, TBD.

To calculate the scores, load in one of the datasets into the R script. I have two here: one that only includes the 2024 NFL draft, but also has round numbers so that scores can be calculated over a set of rounds, and another that has data from 2022-2024 that does not include round numbers. I should be able to build up this dataset to include every NFL draft.
